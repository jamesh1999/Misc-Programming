All of the CPU instructions are available including several macros:
NOOP - No operation
BGT - Branch greater than
BGTU - Granch greater than unsigned
BGE - Branch greater than or equal to
BGEU - Branch greater than or equal to unsigned
GOTO
PUSH - Stack push
POP - Stack pop
DEL - Stack delete
TOP - View top of stack
CALL - Call a function
RET - Return from a function
INC - Increment
INCU - Increment unsigned
DEC - Decrement
DECU - Decrement unsigned
MOV - Move
CLEAR - Sets the value of the specified register to 0

It is recommended not to use the immediate or unsigned instructions since the assembler will automatically select the immediate varients if necessary and the unsigned varients will be selected if all of the involved registers are unsigned.

The syntax for each instruction is as follows:
OPCODE DESTINATION_REGISTER INPUT_REGISTER[S] [IMMEDIATE]

Branches can use this alternative syntax:
BRANCH (REGISTER BOOLEAN_OPERATOR REGISTER) :DEST [RDEST]

Goto locations are set as follows:
:LOOP

Functions must begin:
>FUNCTION

and are called with:
CALL :FUNCTION

To set a register to signed/unsigned:
SIGNED@REGISTER
UNSIGNED@REGISTER

To import another assembly file use:
IMPORT filename.al
The filename is caps sensitive

Capitalization does not matter. The assembler will automatically capitalize everything before processing it.
