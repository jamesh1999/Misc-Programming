All of the CPU instructions are available including several macros:
NOOP - No operation
BGT - Branch greater than
BGTU - Granch greater than unsigned
BGE - Branch greater than or equal to
BGEU - Branch greater than or equal to unsigned
GOTO
PUSH - Stack push
POP - Stack pop
DEL - Stack delete
TOP - View top of stack
CALL - Call a function
RET - Return from a function
INC - Increment
INCU - Increment unsigned
DEC - Decrement
DECU - Decrement unsigned
MOV - Move
CLEAR - Sets the value of the specified register to 0
SET - Sets a register to a specific value

The syntax for each instruction is as follows:
OPCODE DESTINATION_REGISTER INPUT_REGISTER[S] [IMMEDIATE]

Branches can use this alternative syntax:
BRANCH REGISTER BOOLEAN_OPERATOR REGISTER :DEST

Goto locations are set as follows:
:LOOP

Functions must begin:
>FUNCTION

and are called with:
CALL :FUNCTION

To import another assembly file use:
IMPORT filename
The filename is caps sensitive

The assembler can also automatically assign registers using the syntax:
$n
These are file specific and will automatically be loaded/stored when required. They will not work in conjunction with definite registers.

Capitalization does not matter. The assembler will automatically capitalize everything before processing it.
